While anticipating this year's National Championship game, I ordered some Pad Thai through DoorDash. The food arrived within 45 minutes, and the taste warranted the price. This got me thinking, how often are people ordering from DoorDash? Does age or income play a factor?
With the help of Excel, I imported a 2,000-row data set and discovered the following: <br>

$1.24 Million was spent on DoorDash in 2018 <br>
Income levels can explain 67% of the spending variance <br>
Growth was constant, with an average of 183 new customers per month.<br>

For this case study, I analyzed different Charter and Public school data for the State of Massachusetts. The Massachusetts school administration wanted to know the following: <br> <br>
Which schools are struggling the most? <br>
What are the top 4th Grade Math schools in the state? <br>
Does the size of the class affect college admission? <br> <br>

#### [Bank Project]()
[<img src= "images/The%20Finance%20Project%20using%20SQL.png"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/finance-project-using-sql-rick-mata/?trackingId=92JtTVIOQOaQYlaadELfoA%3D%3D)
In most organizations, the datasets can easily result in over a billion rows of data! When it comes to a massive dataset, we can only rely on something other
than Microsoft Excel and must use the correct programming language. I used SQL (Structured Query Language) for this project, which easily handles excessive 
amounts of data. After observing the data, I was able to determine the following: <br>

How many transactions did Nicaragua have? <br>
What was the largest transaction Nicaragua made? <br>
What is the service charge rate for Nicaragua? <br>
What is the max amount owed to the IDA? <br>

<br> <br>
A hospital administrator hired me to gather data to gather insight into a patient's data, which included duration, treatment, demographic, and what type 
of specialty doctor was needed. After observing the data, I was able to determine the following: <br>

How often were patients staying in the hospital? <br>
What is the correlation between the number of lab procedures increased per day? <br>
Does ethnicity play a factor in the number of lab procedures needed? <br>
What specialty doctor or procedure was needed, and how often on average? <br>
Did the number of medications and procedures given to patients play a significant role in the duration of the patient's visit to the ER? <br>

For this project, I have been tasked with analyzing the dataset from the latest season to see how NBA superstars helped contribute to their
team's success.What player at each position had the most assist? Do Point and Shooting guards have the highest 3-point percentage in the Association? 
Lastly, did Jokic deserve his MVP over Giannis and Joel Embid? After observing the data, I was able to determine the following: <br>

Who led their team in scoring? <br>
What position had the highest 3-point Shooting %? <br>
What player at each position had the most assist? <br>
Did Jokic deserve his MVP over Giannis and Joel Embid? <br>

#### [Python Project]()
[<img src="Python Data Analysis for Mining Operations.png"/>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/python-data-analysis-mining-operations-rick-mata/?published=t)
<br> <br>
In my current project, I concentrated on implementing Python within an engineering context. As a data analyst for Metals 'R' US, a mining corporation, I am tasked with utilizing data from the flotation plant to address business inquiries and obtain pertinent information for leadership. After observing the data, I was able to determine the following: <br>

Is it possible to obtain the count, median, minimum, and maximum values for each column in the dataset?
Was there any anomaly in collecting samples on 6/1/2017?
Do we observe a correlation among the various variables we have identified?
Does the % Iron Concentrate exhibit any variations throughout the day? Additionally, are there any other variables that we can present?
