While anticipating this year's National Championship game, I ordered some Pad Thai through DoorDash. The food arrived within 45 minutes, and the taste warranted the price. This got me thinking, how often are people ordering from DoorDash? Does age or income play a factor?
With the help of Excel, I imported a 2,000-row data set and discovered the following: <br>

$1.24 Million was spent on DoorDash in 2018 <br>
Income levels can explain 67% of the spending variance <br>
Growth was constant, with an average of 183 new customers per month.<br>

#### [Education Project]()

For this case study, I analyzed different Charter and Public school data for the State of Massachusetts. The Massachusetts school administration wanted to know the following: <br> <br>
Which schools are struggling the most? <br>
What are the top 4th Grade Math schools in the state? <br>
Does the size of the class affect college admission? <br> <br>
The focal point was to give a complete report on each school's performance. I used Tableau to determine the above questions and find the answers.
